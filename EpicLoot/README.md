This mod aims to add a loot drop experience to Valheim similar to Diablo or other RPGs. Monsters and chests can now drop Magic, Rare, Epic, Legendary, or Mythic magic items. Each magic item has a number of magic effects on it, that give bonuses to the item or your character when that magic item is equipped.

The mod is currently in ***Early Access***! That means it's **not done**! Be patient as the author adds new features, fixes bugs, and finishes things up. If you want to help, please provide feedback on the [Nexus mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/387) or on the [github](https://github.com/RandyKnapp/ValheimMods/tree/main/EpicLoot) for the following:

  * **Bugs** *(check to make sure your bug is new and not already reported)*
  * **Balance Issues** *(drops too strong? Too weak? Ruin the crafting progression?)*
  * **Missing content** *(check the TODO list below to make sure the author isn't already planning to do it)*
  * **Suggestions** for new magic item effects
  * **Suggestions** for something else like UI or art improvements

***EpicLoot works in multiplayer and on dedicated servers!*** The server and all players should have the mod and its dependencies installed.

## Ashlands Update Notice!

The Ashlands update introduced the addition of the Mythic tier rarity, as well as a huge rebalance of the mod to be more vanilla friendly. If you are upgrading from a previous version you may wish to restore the old values. There is now an add-on with patches to restore the old Epic values: [thunderstore link](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/RandyKnapp/EpicPatches_EpicLoot/).

Mythic sets have not been created for the base mod, but the feature is available if you wish to create your own sets and add them with the patching system.

## Installation

Copy the contents of "plugins" to a new folder called "EpicLoot" in your BepInEx/plugins directory (on both clients and dedicated servers). Currently all main mod json files must be contained in the same folder as the EpicLoot.dll file. When using a thunderstore mod manager these files should be placed in the correct directory for you.

## Current Known Mod Conflicts
