    // regen paused. Wading out to knee depth or swimming freezes it. Crouching on the ice, or running dry, breaks it, and
    // it stays broken until the wearer is back on solid ground or presses crouch again while swimming.
    //
    // The ice is a real collider rather than patched physics: one invisible box under the local player, on the Water
    // layer, excluded from everything but the "character" layer. Vanilla counts any contact below the capsule as ground,
    // so walking, jumping, dodging and footsteps just work, and every water reaction (swimming, Wet, splash steps, the
    // Ashlands burn) keys off the liquid depth at the feet, which the ice keeps at 0. It has no Rigidbody, so it never
    // becomes a ground body whose velocity vanilla adds to the player. The Water layer is in no vanilla ray mask but the
    // water-piece placement one, so projectiles, melee, the camera, AI and ordinary building all ignore it.
    //
    // Everything runs in a CalculateLiquidDepth postfix: it is the first step of Character.CustomFixedUpdate, so a lift
    // or a depth override is seen by UpdateWater, UpdateGroundContact, UpdateMotion and UpdateAshlandsWater that tick.
    // The Eitr is taken from m_eitr directly rather than through UseEitr, whose EpicLoot patches (adrenaline on Eitr
    // use, cost reduction, cost conversion) would all react to a 50 Hz drain. The owner mirrors "the ice is holding me"
    // and "I wear the full set" to its ZDO: FrostwalkerIceField on every client lays ice chunks around and ahead of any
    // player with the first, and FrostwalkerSnow sheds snowflakes around any player with the second.
