    // Kinetic Quake (4-piece Hrungnir's Stand set bonus, NoRoll). Every attack the player blocks stores a charge; the
    // effect value is how many it takes (16 / 14 / 12 at Legendary / Mythic / Ancient). Once charged, the next attack
    // blocked releases a rock shockwave: a line of eruptions racing Length metres along the blocking direction, hitting
    // every enemy in a Width-wide band once, as the wave reaches it, for DamagePercent of the shield's block power as
    // blunt, with stagger and knockback.
    //
    // What counts: a held block -- BlockAttack returned true, the guard did not break (AddStaggerDamage said no) and
    // stamina remained, which is vanilla's own success flag -- against an attack that has an attacker, vanilla's
    // condition for block adrenaline. Guard breaks never count, though vanilla grants adrenaline for them. Armed is
    // read before the block, so the block that fills the bar does not also release it, and the releasing block adds no
    // charge. The quake's own hits and staggers are not blocks, so they never refill it.
    //
    // The charge never decays. It is kept while the set is off, and saved in the character's custom data, so it
    // survives logout; a static count carries it across a respawn in the same session.
    //
    // Multiplayer: blocking runs on the blocker's own client, so everything happens there. The damage is dealt by that
    // client as a bonus hit (see HitSource). One RPC sends the wave's origin, direction and step count to every client,
    // which walks the same steps and plays the eruptions locally. The charge level shows on every client as 1-5 rocks
    // orbiting the player, from an int the owner mirrors to the player ZDO.
